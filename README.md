### Log Note

I refined the `focus-visible` styles to provide a more polished and accessible user experience.  
I chose not to implement `motion-safe` because the animations on this site are subtle, and the primary intent of the portfolio is to showcase my development skills rather than emphasize accessibility for motion preferences.
